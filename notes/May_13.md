Got my inspiration from this video by LTT: [FriendlyElec CM3588 NAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsM6b5yix0U)   

Then I saw this video by TechHut: [5 reasons everyone needs a home server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-Eam9IZJY)
In this video I saw a comment about a person in law school watching his previous video about raspi and getting motivated to start a whole home server setup and how its super helpful to him now. In the comment, he pointed to a few applications called arr apps running in docker containers. 

This pushed me down a rabbit hole NGL :laughing:
