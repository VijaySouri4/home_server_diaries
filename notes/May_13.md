Got my inspiration from this video by LTT: [FriendlyElec CM3588 NAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsM6b5yix0U)   

Then I saw this video by TechHut: [5 reasons everyone needs a home server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ-Eam9IZJY)
In this video I saw a comment about a person in law school watching his previous video about raspi and getting motivated to start a whole home server setup and how its super helpful to him now. In the comment, he pointed to a few applications called arr apps running in docker containers. 

This pushed me down a rabbit hole NGL :laughing:

Anyway, I would first like to setup my hardware with CM3588 and then start working with openmediavalut and Plex. I am not sure how plex can pull from openmediavalue or how they work in general. I am not even sure if both these things can exist on the CM3588 together or if CM3588 can even run plex. Their website does suggest that it is Ubuntu and Debian "accelerated", which I am not sure what it means. 

All in all too noob right now to understand these things. 

Also in the video by TechHut, he talks about his sponsor, twingate and how it allows you to setup access to your server and how its free for five users. I am not sure if this will be vaiable. There might be oss options. I shuold explore.
